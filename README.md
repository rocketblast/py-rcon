py-rcon
=======
## This is a proof of concept and should NOT be used in production. Use [rcon-troller](https://github.com/rocketblast/rcon-troller) instead!

This is a basic package for python, to handle basic back-end connections to game server. In the future it will be able to handle multiple connections to multiple games. py-rcon will also be able to have it's own plugins in the future.
